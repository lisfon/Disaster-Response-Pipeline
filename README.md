## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

With this project, which is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program of Udacity, I analysed the disaster data provided by Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

## File Descriptions and results <a name="files"></a>

The repository is structured as follows:

- data: containing the two datasets used as input as well as the cleaned and prepared dataset obtained from their merge and the Python code for the data preparation.
- models: containing the machine learning pipeline to categorize the disaster events
- app: containing the script for a web app showing visualizations of the data and a classification function

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit for the data and the project initiative goes to Figure Eigth and Udacity.
